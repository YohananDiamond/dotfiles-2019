# dotfiles

This repository is a collection for my dotfiles for bash, vim, tmux, termux and some others.

## Directories

Most of my dotfiles are categorized in these directories:

## Installation

While this is open for everyone to access, I don't recommend simply copying these files.
I believe it's better for you to only get what you need from these files and slowly add what you *want* and *understand* to your own setup.

Also, there usually are a lot of frequent and unstable commits, since I use git and GitHub themselves to sync with my phone, but most of them are on the `nightly` branch.

But if you want to use it anyways or simply take a look on how it works:

```
./install.sh
```
